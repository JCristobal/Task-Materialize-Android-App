# Android App - Task: Materialize this app.

This project is an example to learn to materialize an Android App.




## Sample Application

The application stored in this repository shows different ways to make a request to a server and consume the data coming back in a JSON format.

Specifically, the request is made to a public API that shows different memes and emotions provided by [All The Rage Faces](http://alltheragefaces.com/) site.

This is the old style: ![](https://github.com/JCristobal/Task-Materialize-Android-App/blob/master/screenshots/basico.png?raw=true)

- [Api documentation](http://alltheragefaces.com/api)  
- [Endpoint used on the sample](http://alltheragefaces.com/api/all/faces)


## First step

[Corresponding commit](https://github.com/JCristobal/Task-Materialize-Android-App/commit/de80cb57280e9b51d4739e3b0e030bede562c64b)

In this approach each element "item_meme" becomes in cardView, with its corresponding animation feature "Material Design". Images are rounded, style is changed and the button "Fav" is added.

After the upgrade would look like: ![](https://github.com/JCristobal/Task-Materialize-Android-App/blob/master/screenshots/primera_aproximacion.png?raw=true)
